Analysis on the German Credit Data

This project is on the analysis of the German Credit Data. 
The German Credit dataset has data on 1000 past credit applicants, described by 30 variables. Each applicant is also rated as “Good” or “Bad” credit (encoded as 1 and 0 respectively in the Response variable). The GermanCredit.xls file contains the variable descriptions and the data. New applicants for credit can be evaluated on these 30 variables. We would like to develop a credit scoring rule that can be used to help determine whether a new applicant presents a good or bad credit risk. Here, we will attempt to obtain a decision tree based model to determine if new applicants present a good or bad credit risk.
